          In this project, we're using exploratory data analysis (EDA) as a way of data exploration to learn new things, find new relationships, put new ideas into practice, and identify patterns in the data. Applying the proper justification for each stage is crucial. to address the primary goal of the research One of the leading users of data science is the credit card division of a bank. The acquisition of new credit card clients has long been a primary priority for the bank. It's dangerous to grant credit cards without conducting adequate investigation or assessing the creditworthiness of applicants. The credit card department has been employing Credit Scoring, a data-driven system for evaluating credit, for many years. The model is referred to as an application scorecard. The application scorecard, which also assists in determining the applicant's level of risk, is used to set the cut-off value for credit card applications.

1.Why credit card approval Prediction is Necessary?
My proposal is important in today's world because it provides a solution for banks to accurately predict the creditworthiness of potential clients. With the increase in financial transactions and the complexity of financial systems, it has become crucial for banks to have tools and techniques to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals. By accurately predicting a good client, banks can minimize the risk of default on loans and credit card payments.
2. How is it going to impact the banking sector?
significant impact on banks' profitability and can also lead to increased interest rates and fees for other cardholders. By accurately predicting the creditworthiness of potential credit card users, banks can offer appropriate credit limits and interest rates, reducing the risk of defaults and ensuring the profitability of their credit card business.
In addition, an accurate prediction of creditworthiness can also benefit the broader economy. By providing loans and credit to individuals who are likely to repay their debts, banks contribute to economic growth and stability. These loans can be used for various purposes, such as starting a business, investing in education, or purchasing a home, which can have a positive impact on employment, innovation, and overall economic development.
3.If any, what is the gap in the knowledge or how your proposed method can be helpful if required in future for any bank in India.
